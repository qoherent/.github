## This is a special repo!

This is a special repository containing community health files and configurations that apply to all repositories 
within the organization. The goal is to centralize various GitHub-related configurations, including issue and pull 
request templates, to promote consistency and reduce redundancy.

These settings can be overridden by adding specific configurations directly to individual repositories.
