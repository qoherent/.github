<!-- A release note is a report published alongside new or updated software that details the technical features of
the product. To write a release note, please copy over this template and fill in the required information.

This template is designed to be generally applicable across all Qoherent's software projects. However, modifications 
may be required to suit the specific needs of individual projects. Please check with the project maintainers to 
determine any specific requirements pertaining to the release notes. 

Version identifiers should adhere to the following scheme: [N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]. For simplicity, most 
projects just use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

The release tag and title should consist solely of the version identifier prefixed with the letter 'v'. 
For example, 'v2.3.4'.

Prior to tagging a new release, please ensure: 
- You have notified the team and obtained approval from the project maintainers.
- All units tests are passing. Depending on the project, manual testing may be required. Please confirm 
the testing requirements with the project maintainers.
- All GitHub actions are passing.
- The documentation is complete, properly formatted, and synchronized with the code.
- If you are releasing to a production system, please do not do so on Friday.

Thank you for taking the time to prepare these release notes, your efforts are greatly appreciated! -->
