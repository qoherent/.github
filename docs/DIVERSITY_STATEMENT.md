At Qoherent, we believe diversity promotes creativity, innovation, and understanding.

We warmly welcome and encourage participation from everyone, regardless of how they identify or may be perceived, 
to the extent that participation does not conflict with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, all business and development activities are conducted in English.

We strive to ensure that our resources, documentation, and communication channels are accessible to individuals of 
all abilities. We welcome feedback and suggestions for improving accessibility through the open [discussion forum](https://github.com/qoherent/ria/discussions/categories/general)
on the RIA Core repository.

Our standards for behaviour are detailed in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We kindly insist that everyone uphold 
these standards in all their interactions and communications.

Let's build intelligent radios together.â„¢ ðŸ“¡ðŸš€
