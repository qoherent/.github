## 🛠️ Radio Intelligence Apps

[RIA](https://www.qoherent.ai/radiointelligenceapps-project/) unlocks solutions in an increasingly congested, contested, and complex wireless spectrum. 

Check out [RIA Core](https://github.com/qoherent/ria), the foundational, open-source core of [RIA Hub](https://riahub.ai/), an extensive AI development 
platform tailored for [software-defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) (SDR). RIA Core is **free and open-source**, released under AGPLv3.
