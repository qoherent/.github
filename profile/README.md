## 🛠️ Radio Intelligence Apps

The [RIA Project](https://www.qoherent.ai/radiointelligenceapps-project/) helps you to unlock solutions in an increasingly congested, contested, and 
complex wireless spectrum. 

Check out [RIA Core](https://github.com/qoherent/ria), the foundational, open-source core of [RIA Hub](https://riahub.ai/), an extensive AI development 
platform tailored for [software-defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) (SDR). RIA Core 
is **free and open-source**, released under AGPLv3. If you like what we're doing, don't forget to give the 
project a star! ⭐
